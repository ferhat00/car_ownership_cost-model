# car_ownership_cost-model
*Function for calculating the ownership of a vehicle based on your inputs and assumptions. Example of code:


Using the function "cost"
cost("BMW","3-series",50000,5000,6,1.09,0.97,12000,40,1.22,400,40,130,12000,500,5,200,150)*


**Means the following inputs:**


Make:  BMW

Model:  3-series

Purchase Cost =  50000

Deposit =  5000

Years to pay off the car =  6

Interest = 1.09

Depreciation factor =  0.97

Mileage per year (miles) = 12000

Fule ecomomy (mpg) = 40

Fuel price (/l) =  1.22

Yearly Insurance = 400

MOT (/year) = 40

TAX(/year)  130

Service every 12000  miles

Service cost (/year) = 500

Years driven = 5

Other maintenance costs (/year) = 200

Other costs like parking fines and traffuc offences (/year) = 150


**The result is the following calculations:**


Monthly Payments = 681.25

Total lifetime service cost = 2500.0

Total Value of Car at the end = 42936.701284999996

Total spend including running costs = 15426.5

Yearly running costs = 3085.3

Yearly running costs including car purchase = 12085.3

Real total spend = 26989.798715000004
